## 🚀 How to Use the Enhanced System

### **For AI Agents (TRAE, Claude Code, Cursor, etc.)**

1. **First Time Setup** (5-10 minutes):
   ```
   Read these files in order:
   1. .agents/README.md - system overview & project scope
   2. .agents/CONTEXT.md - deep learner profiles & 11-week structure
   3. .agents/roles/[your-role]/AGENT.md - your complete role definition
   ```

2. **Activate Your Role** (use copy-paste prompts):
   ```
   Go to: .agents/QUICK_START.md
   Section: "Copy-Paste Activation Prompts"
   Copy: "Prompt 1: Content Enhancer (Week 1)" (or your role)
   Paste: Into your AI agent chat
   ```

3. **Execute Work**:
   - Follow `.agents/templates/lesson-enhancement.md` (15-step process)
   - Reference `.agents/references/quick-reference.md` for daily patterns
   - Consult `.agents/references/troubleshooting.md` if issues arise
   - Track progress in `.agents/roles/[your-role]/CHECKLIST.md`

### **For Humans (Project Managers)**

1. **Understand the Scope**:
   - Total time: 60-80 hours (solo) or 40-60 hours (parallel multi-agent)
   - 11 weeks of content to enhance
   - Target audience: Adult learners (25-45), justice-impacted, career changers

2. **Assign Agent Roles**:
   - **Content Enhancer** = Primary (TRAE?) → 44-66 hours
   - **Notebook Developer** = Support (Claude Code?) → 22-33 hours  
   - **Assessment Creator** = Support (Cursor?) → 22-33 hours
   - **Documentation Manager** = QA (any agent) → 11-22 hours

3. **Coordinate Workflow** (Week 1 example):
   - Day 1-2: Content Enhancer enhances HTML lesson
   - Day 3-4: Notebook Developer creates notebooks
   - Day 5: Assessment Creator builds assignment
   - Day 6: Documentation Manager runs QA
   - Repeat for Weeks 2-11

4. **Track Progress**:
   - Check `.agents/roles/[role]/CHECKLIST.md` files
   - Monitor handoffs between agents
   - Quality checks: mobile responsiveness (375px test), code testing (Python 3.8+)
