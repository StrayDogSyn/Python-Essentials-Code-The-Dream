## 🎯 Your 7 Documentation Files

### Files to Add (Optional)

If you have your original 7 files, you can add them to `.agents/references/` for additional reference:

1. **master-guide-index.md** → Already implemented in `AGENTS_SYSTEM_GUIDE.md`
2. **repository-agent-structure-guide.md** → Can place in `.agents/references/structure-guide.md`
3. **agent-system-starter-files.md** → Implemented (this folder structure)
4. **trae-build-prompts-curriculum-enhancement.md** → Core patterns in `PROMPTS.md`, can add full version to `.agents/references/build-prompts-full.md`
5. **quick-reference-implementation-checklist.md** → Implemented as `.agents/references/quick-reference.md`
6. **lesson-enhancement-template.md** → Implemented as `.agents/templates/lesson-enhancement.md`
7. **troubleshooting-guide-trae.md** → Implemented as `.agents/references/troubleshooting.md`

**Note**: Your system is fully functional without adding these - they've been integrated into the structure!
